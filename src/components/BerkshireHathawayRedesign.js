                        Due to the usability issues with Berkshire Hathaway's original website, I created a redesign to address concerns with usability, learnability and memorability. Specifically, there were disorganized pieces of information, links and small text, with very little structure or organization. Users who rely on screen readers will not know how the page is organized and would be very confused as to how to navigate the website. My redseign added an element of organization, as well as aesthetically being a drastic improvement. Please see the links below to see the original website and the redesign.
